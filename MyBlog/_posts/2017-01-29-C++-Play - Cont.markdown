In the previous blog post I covered a lot of ground: variadic templates, improvements to classes, improvements to standard library, smart pointers and lambdas. 
We also briefly touched move semantics as well as decltype and declval. In this part I am going to continue with move and local storage for threads while briefly touching 
thread support in the new standard library, delegated constructors, user defined literals and static_assert.
