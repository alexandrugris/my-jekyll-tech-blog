Intervention in a system based on incorrect assumptions about data generated by it demonstratably leads to worst future behavior than in the case of non-intervention. However, in most cases, our bias to action or external pressure force us to make changes, leaving the system in a worst shape. Assuming a system is producing consistent data, how do we know when or if to intervene? This article introduces the notion of System Behavior Charts which is tightly connected to any methodology that has the aim of continuous improvement. 

### Definitions

1. System behavior chart - a chart that plots system output data over time
2. Noise - normal variation occuring from one measurement to the next
3. Signal - meaningful variation, something we should act on.
4. Upper / lower natural system limits - the limits within which the system produces naturally varying output

The problem to solve: how do we know when we are dealing with noise and when we have a real signal
