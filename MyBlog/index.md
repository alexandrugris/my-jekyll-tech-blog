![This is me](assets/alexandrugris.png){: .face-alex-gris }

This blog is a complement to [www.alexandrugris.ro](http://www.alexandrugris.ro) and is dedicated to technology. It started from my private notebook where I jot down interesting stuff I read on tech, so that I have a reference point for later use. Then, I thought, hey, why not make it public? So here it is: “From The Trenches - The Code”.

Who am I?

My name is Alexandru Gris. Most of my professional life I have spent working in the videogames industry, with [Ubisoft Entertainment](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-GB/) for about 10 years. 
During my career there, I had various positions: engine developer, lead programmer, producer and, finally, studio production manager (Head Of Game Development). I love technology, I love building stuff while working with smart, creative people. 
I have a deep interest in software architecture, clean code, leadership, organization design, entrepreneurial thinking and high quality project management.

I curretly work as CTO in the sports betting industry.
