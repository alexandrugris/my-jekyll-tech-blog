The blog uses a modified version of the [Minima Theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), with a design inspired by [Ed](https://github.com/elotroalex/ed). 
It is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), CSS3, HTML, Markdown, and [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/).

You can find the original source code for the Jekyll Minima theme at:
